The bash scripts in the nfs, oim, sbt, and cohesityadapter folders can be used either to generate RMAN commands exclusively or to generate and execute RMAN commands for working with the Cohesity platform. When the "\-w yes" option is included as part of the input, it generates RMAN commands and stores them in a CSV file with a suffix in the \<bash script directory\>/log/\<oracle server name\> directory, based on the provided inputs. Without the "\-w yes" option, the bash script will execute the generated RMAN commands.

The bash script in the datapump folders can be used either to generate Oracle export commands exclusively or generate and execute Oracle export commands for working with the Cohesity platform. When the "\-w yes" is included as part of the input, it generates Oracle export commands and stores them in a CSV file with a suffix in the \<bash script directory\>/log/\<oracle server name\> directory, based on the provided inputs. Without the "\-w yes" option, the bash script will execute the generated Oracle export commands.
