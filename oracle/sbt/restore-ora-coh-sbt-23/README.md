## Description
This bash script utilizes the RMAN restore/recover command to restore a database from the backup taken by using the backup-ora-coh-sbt-23.bash script if it is an Oracle database on Linux. It can be used to restore the original Oracle database in the event of corruption or server/storage failures.
